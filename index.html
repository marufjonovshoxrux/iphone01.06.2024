            <h2>For a limited time, get extra credit with Apple Trade In.</h2><br>
            <p style="color:#86868b; font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Now through June 3, get $200–$650 in credit
                toward a new iPhone when you trade in iPhone 11 or higher.***
                You can also get trade-in credit with a carrier deal, right here at Apple.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Here’s how it works:</b></p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>1.See what your smartphone is worth.</b><br>
                Answer a few questions to get your estimated trade-in value.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>2.Choose your payment method.</b><br>
                Your trade-in value can be applied to any payment option. If you choose Buy, we'll credit your
                payment method after we receive and evaluate your trade-in. If you finance through Apple, the
                credit is applied instantly. If you finance with your carrier, your maximum trade-in value will
                be applied as an instant credit or bill credits (depending on your carrier). If you select a
                carrier deal, we'll let you know if you need to switch to a qualifying plan.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>3.Get ready to trade in your device.</b><br>
                We'll mail you a trade-in kit. It may either come with your new iPhone or will be mailed
                separately once your order is ready for delivery or pickup. Follow the email instructions on
                how to back up and transfer your data, and how to prepare your device before shipping it to
                us.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>4.Ship your trade-in device within 14 days of receiving
                    your trade-in kit.</b><br>
                After we receive your device, our team will inspect and verify its condition. If your device matches the
                original
                condition, your trade-in will be complete. If it doesn't, you'll get an email with next steps.</p>
            <p><b>How recycling your device works:</b><br>
                If your device doesn't qualify for trade-in credit, we'll recycle it for free. Once you complete
                your purchase, you'll get an email with a prepaid shipping label and instructions on how to pack up
                your device and send it your nearest drop-off location.
                <br><br>
                We can also help you recycle your other devices, cables, cases, monitors, and more. Recycle them for
                free at an Apple Store location or visit apple.com/shop/trade-in for information on other options.
                Your items will be re-used or disposed of in an environmentally responsible way.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 15px; color:#86868b"><br><br>◊◊ Trade‑in values will vary based on the condition, year,
                and configuration of your eligible
                trade‑in device. Not all devices are eligible for credit. You must be at least the age of
                majority to be eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade‑in value may be
                applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value
                awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying device matching the description provided when
                estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In‑store
                trade‑in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may require saving this
                information). Offer may not be available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online
                trade‑in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade‑in partners reserve
                the right to refuse, cancel, or limit quantity of any trade‑in transaction for any reason. More
                details are available from Apple’s trade‑in partner for trade‑in and recycling of eligible
                devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 13px; color:#86868b">◊ Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment
                option that is only
                available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at
                Apple Store locations, apple.com(Opens in a new window), the Apple Store app, or by
                calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
                support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens in a new window) for more information about eligible
                products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who
                accept an Apple Card on and/or after February 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple Card,
                other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of
                February 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates
                and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card
                (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0%
                APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR.
                When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as
                your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so
                you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at
                the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate
                Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans
                and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for
                each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the
